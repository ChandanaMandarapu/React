## Project Overview

Step 1: We begin by importing some essential stuff. We need React to create our app, and we also import some styles from a file called "style.css." Additionally, we grab a tool called "useState" from React that helps us manage the changing parts of our app.

Step 2: Now, we create a part of our app called Toggle. It's like a small program that lets you switch between light and dark themes.

Step 3: Inside this Toggle program, we have three special storage boxes (variables) that hold important information:

* backgroundColor: This box stores the color of the background.
* textColor: This one keeps track of the color of the text.
* buttonStyle: And this box stores the color of the button.

Step 4: We create a set of instructions for what should happen when you click a button. We call these instructions handleClick. When you click the button, this function follows the steps below:

* It checks the current background color.
* If the background is white, it changes the background to black and the text color to orange. Also, it makes the button black.
* But if the background is already black, it switches them all back to white.

Step 5: Here comes the part you see on the screen. We tell our app what it should show on the webpage:

* There's a big section with some text inside. This section's background and text color depend on those special storage boxes we mentioned earlier.
* Inside this section, there's a button that says "Change Theme." When you click it, it calls the handleClick function we talked about in step 4.
* The button itself changes color based on whether it's light or dark mode.

That's it! In simple terms, this code creates a button that changes the colors of a section and a button on your webpage. When you click the button, it toggles between light and dark modes.
